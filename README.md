# SNMPTool 
This is a basic SNMPv2 tool to perform get/set operations
## Installation
* To use this tool, make sure you have [pysnmp](https://github.com/etingof/pysnmp) installed. To use additional features, you also need to install [pysnmp-mibs](https://github.com/etingof/pysnmp-mibs) 
* After you did all of the above, just download all the files in the *src* folder, execute *SNMPTool.py* and enjoy!

*For more detailed information about every command, type /help when you execute the program!*
#### Warning
For the execution of the program the *venv* folder is not necessary, but I pushed it anyways to have a copy of my virtual environment used py Pycharm
